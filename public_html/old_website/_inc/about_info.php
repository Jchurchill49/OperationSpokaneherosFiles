    <p>Dear Community of Military Supporters,<br /><br />

      I invite you to check out the Operation Spokane<br />
      Heroes Committee!<br /><br />
      This dedicated group of individuals spends their
      time providing support to military men and
      women and their families because we believe it
      is our responsibility to do so.<br /><br />
      The men and women who serve our country and
      make sacrifices on our behalf deserve to know
      that everything is being taken care of back home.<br /><br />
      We encourage anyone who is interested in
      joining the group in support of this great cause<br />
      to do so!<br />
      <br />
  
      Sandy Kates<br />
      Chair, Operation Spokane Heroes</p>
