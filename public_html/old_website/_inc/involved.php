         Men and women from every branch of the military
are answering the call to protect the freedoms that
make this nation great, but the call to action is not
for them to answer alone. It is up to each of us to do
our part to support our military, and perhaps more
importantly, to support the families of those who
have left for foreign soil.
<br />
<br />
OSH is designed to help us, as a community, do just
that. By showing our support to military families,
we let them know their importance to the Spokane
Region and our country. This past year OSH helped
families of deployed service personnel from the National
Guard, Reserves and Active Duty. There is always
more that can be done.<br />
