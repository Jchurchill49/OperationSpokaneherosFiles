6 Foods That Make You Younger

Brace yourself. I am about to make your DAY.

Because I'm going to tell you about 6 "star" foods that are not only =
scrumptious, but actually have anti-aging properties.  They can =
literally make you feel, look and act younger...all the way down to the =
cellular level.

Now, you can forget about Tim Horton's being the secret to everlasting =
life. Alas, donuts are not on the list; however, these 6 foods are =
definitely WAY up there on most people's "yummy" meter.

You younger guys and gals might be thinking, "Who cares? I'm only 25. =
Why should I care about anti-aging?"

The answer: You'd better care...

Even in your 20's and 30's your body starts to show signs of aging. Gray =
hairs appear. Lines form on your face. Little aches and pains creep up =
that "grow up" into arthritis or fibromyalgia.

Soon enough you'll start looking like your parents, and that shoulder =
you hurt when you were nine will start to ache every day.  Your =
grandfather's painful arthritis will be your painful arthritis.

And your arteries begin getting the wear and tear that eventually can =
become atherosclerosis, leading to a stroke or heart attack.

So to be able to have a fountain of youth on a plate that not only helps =
fight the aging process at ANY age but also tastes sinfully delicious =
is, well, having your cake and eating it, too.

Without further ado, here are the six Anti-Aging "Stars":

1) Wild Alaskan Salmon

Wild Alaskan salmon is one of the best sources of omega-3 essential =
fatty acids in the world, helping to reverse the chronically imbalanced =
omega-6 to omega-3 ratios that most people have.

Omega-3 EFAs are essential for heart and brain health, circulation, =
memory and control of blood sugar. They're also a natural =
anti-inflammatory and help to fight inflammation-related conditions such =
as arthritis and fibromyalgia.

Salmon also is a great source of protein, potassium, Vitamin B12 =
<http://www.bluerockholistics.com/product/hydroxaden.asp> , niacin and =
the anti-cancer trace mineral selenium (which has been shown to help =
reduce breast cancer risk).
=20

2) Extra Virgin Olive Oil

Extra virgin olive oil is very high in phenols, which are potent =
antioxidants. It is also a heart-healthy monounsaturated fat that helps =
improve your HDL/LDL cholesterol ratio.

Studies of a Mediterranean-type diet have shown that consumption of =
olive oil is associated with a reduction in mortality of people with =
heart disease as well as lowering blood pressure.

Research also shows that olive oil may help protect against colon cancer =
and bowel cancer. You can use it in salad dressings and it's a great =
choice for cooking too.
=20

3) Raw Almonds

Raw (not roasted) almonds are an excellent source of monounsaturated =
fat, which not only helps lower cholesterol but is associated with lower =
levels of heart disease and cancer, as well as longer life spans.

Almonds also contain protein, fiber and calcium, as well as phosphorus, =
vitamin E and magnesium. And since they contain no carbohydrates, =
they're perfect for diabetics.
=20

4) Blueberries

Blueberries are both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, and help to =
fight and prevent major serious diseases including Parkinson's, cancer, =
heart disease, diabetes and arthritis.

Compounds in blueberries called polyphenols help strengthen memory and =
slow or prevent the decreased coordination and balance associated with =
advancing age.

They can also help lower blood cholesterol, encourage urinary health and =
protect against glaucoma and cataracts.
=20

5) Red wine

Moderate consumption of red wine (1-2 glasses per day) not only helps =
reduce risk of cardiovascular disease, but red wine also has one of the =
highest phenol contents of any food or drink.

(I know many of you just breathed a sigh of relief.)

Phenols are food for the beneficial bacteria (probiotics) in your gut, =
which can keep your immune system strong to help fight diseases like =
cancer. Alcohol in excess is generally not good for health, but keep it =
red and keep it moderate and you'll be happy in your old age.
=20

And the ultimate dream come true for many (including yours truly):

6) Dark chocolate

Dark chocolate and dark cocoa powder are excellent sources of =
probiotic-nourishing dietary phenols. (Skip the milk chocolate because =
its processing decreases the phenol content.)

The higher the cocoa content, the higher the phenols.

Cocoa is also rich in flavanols that help preserve the health of your =
blood vessels. Maintaining healthy, elastic blood vessels lowers your =
risk of high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, kidney disease and =
dementia.

Now, this is not an invitation to explode your chocolate intake if you =
already get plenty... but an occasional treat of a nice piece of dark =
chocolate will make your tongue dance AND help fight the effects of =
aging.

**********

So there you have them -- the Anti-Aging Stars.

But remember the most important part...

...If you combine these with the wrong other foods, you turn these =
anti-aging dynamos into age accelerating, disease-creating monsters!

Anti-aging is not just what to eat, it's what to eat TOGETHER. THAT'S =
the ticket to real lasting health and slowing down the effects of aging.

The manuals in the Great Taste No Pain Digestive Health System =
<http://www.greattastenopain.com/great.asp>  will show you everything =
you need to know.

The manual  <http://www.greattastenopain.com/great.asp> "What To Eat =
With What" spells out exactly what you should have with your favorite =
foods to keep digestion smooth and efficient.

 <http://www.greattastenopain.com/great.asp> "Foods That Create Acid, =
Foods That Take It Away" explains the dangers of excess acid wastes in =
your body and how they contribute to rapid aging and disease, as well as =
shows you which foods are acid-forming vs. alkaline.

And the GTNP recipe book <http://www.greattastenopain.com/great.asp>  is =
loaded with spectacular yet easy to prepare dishes (including great =
recipes using the Anti-Aging Stars above) that will make you feel like =
you're dining in the finest restaurants -- right in your own home.

Even MORE anti-aging help

The modern diets of today have resulted in most people having truck =
loads of harmful bacteria overgrowth in their intestines (dysbiosis), as =
well as diminished their ability to produce adequate digestive =
enzymes--which destroys digestion.

Nothing can make you feel (and look) old faster than poor digestion and =
a weak immune system and a leaky gut, as well as heartburn, gas, =
bloating and constipation from poor digestion!

But you can help restore these crucial balances in your body and start =
feeling better than you have in YEARS.

Super Shield multi-strain probiotic formula =
<http://www.bluerockholistics.com/product/pross.asp>  can give your body =
a boost of the friendly bacteria it needs so you can have a stronger gut =
wall, more efficient digestion and a sharpened immune system.

And Digestizol Max <http://www.bluerockholistics.com/product/dmax.asp>  =
can give your body a much-welcome enzyme boost to help it completely =
break down all the foods you've eaten, including proteins, carbs, fats, =
fiber and dairy!=20

While no one can completely stop the biological clock, you can help slow =
it WAAAY down -- at any age.

Experience the anti-aging power of Great Taste No Pain =
<http://www.greattastenopain.com/great.asp> , Super Shield =
<http://www.bluerockholistics.com/product/pross.asp>  and Digestizol Max =
<http://www.bluerockholistics.com/product/dmax.asp> .

You'll likely feel better than you have in YEARS.

To your health,

Sherry Brescia

PPS: Dallas is off Nexium and looking younger already!

Hi Sherry:

I have been on Great Taste No Pain for nearly a week, and OMG the day =
long sharp pains in my stomach stopped almost immediately!

I am now trying out many of your recipes on my family. It's all about =
relearning what is good and what is going to hurt, but your book is =
certainly easy to understand and read.

I no longer take Nexium, which I was needing daily to calm my tummy.

I have been getting comments from work mates at how much better and =
younger I look - and it's only been a week!

Thanks heaps, Sherry.
