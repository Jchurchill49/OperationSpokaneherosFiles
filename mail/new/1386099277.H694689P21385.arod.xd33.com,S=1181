Message: I publish the free resource guide for the 5 northern counties of Idaho and neighboring communities. Each edition has veteran/military specific information. If you have activities you would like me to include at no cost, please contact me - 208-263-5654.  We print twice a year, so the next one would need events from May through October 2014.  Go to our website and see the flip-pages version: www.thewiseguideonline.com    We attend local stand downs and last year handed out over 1000 to local veterans.
