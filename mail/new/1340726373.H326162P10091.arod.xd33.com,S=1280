Message: I represent WGU Washington, Washington's state-endorsed, online, and nonprofit university. We are a Yellow Ribbon School and have been named one of the top military friendly schools for the fifth year in a row. I would like to get in touch with someone in Operation Spokane Heroes to get information about participating in local support events for military and spouses. We have special scholarships set aside for military students and military spouses, and I am eager to make sure they get used! I look forward to your response, and to furthering our involvement in the military community here in Spokane.
