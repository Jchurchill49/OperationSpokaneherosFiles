Good Day!

Google is the dominant way that customers identify products and services, 
today, so getting to the top of Google (SEO) is a critical marketing function
for business success.

This will not be your usual boring PowerPoint, nor a pure sales pitch.  You
will learn each and every tool for Google / SEO.  It will be well worth your time!

JEALOUSY

...among human beings jealousy ranks distinctly as a weakness; a trademark of small 
minds; a property of all small minds, yet a property which even the smallest is 
ashamed of; and when accused of its possession will lyingly deny it and resent the 
accusation as an insult.
- Mark Twain
