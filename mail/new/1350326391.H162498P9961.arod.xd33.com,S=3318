Message: Hi, We received the following inquiry this morning via our national headquarters. I'm without many resources in this area and was wondering if you can help this Veteran or have any suggestions over and above what he is already doing.

Thanks

> I am a US Navy Veteran of OEF. I recently moved to Washington a few months back, and came to the area of Republic. I had just gotten registered with the Spokane VA, at the recent Veteran's stand down, in Colville.
> 
> However, recently, I got into a wreck, and am now, for all intents, stranded in Republic. There is a "ride service" from Republic to Colville, on Fridays, and I'd get into Colville sometime after 10 am. The problem is that the DAV that only goes as far as Colville, leaves Colville at 9am, and is only available on Tuesdays.
> 
> My prime income is my VA disability of 30%, minus around $56/mo to pay student loans, from a wage garnishment. I basically work on a ranch, in Republic, and this is mainly just for a cabin. Occasionally, I get commissions from the wood sales (I work at the lumber yard). Even though I work, on average of 40 hours a week (if it's M-F, more if work weekends), since there can be some weeks in the winter, where we're not working, OJT wouldn't qualify it, mainly since it is "seasonal."
> 
> I contacted the Veteran Crisis Line, and they put me in touch with a councilor and the Spokane homeless; if I stopped working at the ranch, I would then be homeless. However, all sources are located in Spokane, and there is apparently nothing that comes out to Republic. In addition, there is all of my belongings, which I fit into my car, before my wreck.
> 
> I was hoping that if there were donated vehicles for needy vets, I could see about getting one, but from what the DAV in Spokane said, they get their vehicles, which are then used by the medical facility to pick up Vets, which don't come out to Republic, apparently. Is there anything that takes donated vehicles, and provides them to disabled vets in need, as opposed to auctioning them off, and using that money for whatever (unless to buy a basic car)?
> 
> I am also trying to see if I can find some sort of employment, where I can 100% telecommute, and to be able to get a steady internet connection, to do this, but with my limits, have been able to find something that works on both areas, and was wondering what options there may be.
