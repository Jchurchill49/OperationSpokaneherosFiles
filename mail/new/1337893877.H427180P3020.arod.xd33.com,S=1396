Message: Good afternoon,  I am the Post 9/11 Transitional Patient Advocate for Spokane VA Medical Center and am coordinating our annual welcome home event to take place on 9-11 - 9-12 this year at the Spokane National Guard Armory.  I would like to be present for the next meeting and to get flyers to you so we can get the word out now.  This year we will focus on Employment, veterans benefits, and reintegration.  Day one will be workshops with specific topics in those areas, and day two will be a job/resource fair.  I am working with Spokane WorkSource in this effort.  I can also be reached by phone at 509-499-8388.  Thanks for all that you do for our local heroes and their families.  best regards, Jennifer
