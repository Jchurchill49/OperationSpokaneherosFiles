Message: I was introduced to the Java for Joes campain.  I am interested in involving my Civil Air Patrol cadets to assist in your fundraising efforts but I have two questions before I procede.  First, does your orginization benefit deployed members of the armed services from the Coeur d Alene area?  Second, should I decide to procede or have more questions, who can I talk to about the program?
