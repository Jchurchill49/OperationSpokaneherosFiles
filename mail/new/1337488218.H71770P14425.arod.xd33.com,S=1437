Message: My husband Lt. Col. Emmett Drumheller and I were stationed at Fairchild AFB from Dec. 1986 thru October of 1992. He was with the 325th Bomb Squadron (B-52's) first as a Navigator then as an Instructor Radar Navigator. Emmett passed away on Christmas morning 2003...He served in Desert Storm, Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom. He was a Weapon's School Graduate with approx. 3000 hours in the B-52. 
My children and I decided to return to the Spokane area in 2006 and now call Washington "home" once again. I would love to help out in whatever capacity I can. I am currently looking for work and would love to speak with someone who could help me. Please feel free to contact me at 509-590-8301. I look forward to meeting you! Sincerely, Mary Drumheller
