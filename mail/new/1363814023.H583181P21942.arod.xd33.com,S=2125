Message: Good afternoon, I stumbled across your facebook page today and was very happy to see it! I am the regional coordinator for a world-wide organization called "Operation Love: ReUnited". We are professional photographers who donate sessions to deployed service members and their families and it is great seeing another organization giving to those who give so much of themselves! I have also been looking for a local charity for a couple months and since your's hits so close to home, I was really drawn to it. I own a photography studio in Spokane Valley and am interested in doing a day or weekend of "donation-session fees"; families would receive a session at our studio for a certain donation amount -have not determined this amount yet. After the weekend of shoots, all of the session fees would be donated to your charity. Along with their donation, my studio would also gift them with a 5x7 print as a thank you. Would this be something you would like to take part in? The main thing that I would need from Operation Spokane Heroes would be to get the word out, either through your meetings...facebook...whatever means you would have in order to get lots of families to book their sessions. I could even make a few posters if you have some places in mind to place them. Please let me know as I would like to do the sessions during my slower time (possibly May). Thank you and I look forward to hearing back from you! -Mica Johnson   (208-596-0823)
