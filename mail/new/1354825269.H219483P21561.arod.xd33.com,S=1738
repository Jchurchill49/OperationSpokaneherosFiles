Message: My name is Heather Bahme I am the VetCorps member here at EWU in the new VRC with David Millet.  I am contacting you regarding a Veteran that we have that we are trying to get into an apartment and he is about $400.00 short on his deposit.  The part that hurts him is he is a single with out any dependents.  He is one of our work study students and is just plain amazing.  He is the type of person that is always giving to other vets and now is in need himself and won't as for help because he thinks it is a sign of weakness.  If he does not get this apartment he will be homeless and then we will have another set of issues to deal with.  He can afford the monthly rent and out of the $1100.00 he he has $800.00.  I am trying to get a hold of Spokane County as well as the HUD/VASH program but have not gotten a return call as of yet.  I don't know were to look right now and any kind of resources that you could assist or even point me in the right direction would be wonderful.
