Message: I am a nursing student and I would like to get a bit more information about your organization to present to my class. I also would like this information so that I can give it to any patients that may benefit from your assistance. 
I would like to know:
Do you have a physical office that patients can come to, and its office hours. Or are you only reachable online/over the phone? Contact phone number?
What are some specific services you provide? Like counseling or community events?
Do people need to be currently serving to take advantages of your services?
Are there any costs?

That's about all I really need to know. Also any information you feel would be helpful would also be nice to know. Thanks for your time.

Kristin L. Johnson
WSU, Student Nurse
