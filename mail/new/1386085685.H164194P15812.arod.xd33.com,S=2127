Message: My name is Michelle Blum and I am the social chair for the Spokane Community College Veterans Club. 



The Spokane Community College Veterans club is going to be hosting an event on February 22, 2014 at our campus that we are called the Spokane Community College Veterans Cultural Connection and I was wondering if you would like to have a table at our event.
 


This year we are trying to get as many outside veteran and military groups together in one location, as well as student organizations, to raise a bigger awareness of the needs of Spokane’s military, veterans and their families. This event will have table displays, a documentary on how gardening has been found to help PTSD, a military/veteran discussion panel, guest speakers and at the end of the event a meal open to all Veterans and their families.
 


We are in currently in the planning phase right now and I am reaching out to different groups to see if they would like to be involved. We are planning to hold a group panel together to be able to discuss what groups and organizations are doing what. Our goal is to be able to reach out to as many people as possible through the news, newspapers, social media and word of mouth. 



I think that our event would be a perfect venue for you to be able to reach a wider audience. Thank you so much for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.
