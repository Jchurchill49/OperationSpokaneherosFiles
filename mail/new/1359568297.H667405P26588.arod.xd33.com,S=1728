Message: Greetings, I am the Vet Corps Prevention Coordinator for Greater Spokane Substance Abuse Council, GSSAC. In a community effort to support our veterans and their families, the Greater Spokane Substance Abuse Council (GSSAC), in partnership with Access To Recovery, Army One Source, Point Man Ministries, the American Red Cross and Gonzaga Law Library, is hosting Healing Communities for Veterans (HC4V), March 12th and 13th at Gonzaga University’s Law Library. 

With a focus on the faith-based community, local non-profits, clergy, law enforcement, school counselors, government leaders, community coalitions, are welcome to join the movement. This free conference will emphasize on mobilizing community engagement with veterans and military families to help relieve issues and stressors as a result of deployment and service.

I would like to send you the flyer for more information. I am not able to attend the monthly meetings as I am a grad student at Whitworth University pursing a Master's in Agency Counciling, I have class on Tuesday evenings.
