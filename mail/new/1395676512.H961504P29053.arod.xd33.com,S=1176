Every year our company pays us to volunteer in the community for two weeks.  We have many capable people who would be happy to offer their services assembling care kits to ship if you have the need.  If you are interested in participating, please email me at Kendra.Morgan@Safeco.com and I will send you the info to sign up. :) Thanks so much! I look forward to hearing from you.
