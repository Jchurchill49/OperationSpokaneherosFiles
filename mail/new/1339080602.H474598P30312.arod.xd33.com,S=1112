Message: Diamond Park N Jet has been offering a 20% Military Discount for years.  We would love to be listed as one of  your businesses that offer discount.  What do I need to do to make that happen?

I also work with the Incredible Corn Maze that takes place at the stateline in the Fall, we too offer a military discount and would like to provide info for your site about that.

Please contact me

Thank you so much
