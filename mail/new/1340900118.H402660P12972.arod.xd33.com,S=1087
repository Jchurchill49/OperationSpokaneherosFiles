Message: Hi Sandy,  Just checking with you again regarding helping out with the USO and orphanage project I presented at your last meeting.  I am ready to kick this off and will need to know if you guys can help out.  I can't remember the gal's name that said she could help collect product.  Can you help me out with some contact information?  Thank you so much!  Keep up the great work -- looking forward to helping out, too!
