Message: Hi!  My name is Katie and my daughter, Fiona (age 10) and I have been doing random acts of kindness each day before Christmas.  During this time, we have been keeping our eyes out for spontaneous acts.  Well, just this evening, we found our biggest one yet.

I saw a post from a friend on Facebook.  (This is someone that I actually know and have verifiable information; it is not a scam or a random posting.)  Her son is in the Marine Corps and is stationed currently in Pensacola, Florida for school, after graduating from boot camp in October.  He has been given leave for the holidays, but found out today.  His family is unable to pay the full amount for the airline ticket, $1400 - $2300.  His brother is also actively serving in the military and his father served as well.  

This family has definitely been committed to serving our great country.  I am hoping to find organizations that could help offset the cost of the flight for the family or perhaps have had airline miles donated.  Is there a possibility that could be a part of making a Christmas miracle and giving this family the most special gift of all…the gift of family?

Thank you,
Katie Wines
