Message: Hello, I was wondering how I could sign up for your help.  I am a mother of 6 and we just recently PCS'd to Spokane from Turkey.  I will be deployed before the end of the month leaving my wonderful husband home with my babies.  I do appreciate people like you and your organization. This will be my 3rd time deploying and leaving my family and to get care packages from people who care really make a difference.  Thank you again.  Rebecca
