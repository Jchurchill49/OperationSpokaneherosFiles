Message: I saw a segment this morning about OSH on channel six news. . I am now retired and have a lot of time to devote to a cause that is close to my heart.  I am anxious to talk to someone about my involvement in this cause.  I have had many family members and friends in the military so am familiar with the sacrifices involved for these families.

I hope to hear from someone soon.

Thank you
