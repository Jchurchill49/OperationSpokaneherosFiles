Message: Would someone in your organization be willing to write a story about Operation Spokane Heroes for an upcoming issue of Spokane Family Magazine?  It would be an un-paid reader submission for our Back Door feature, which is reserved for stories filled with hope/inspiration about our community.

The story would need to be about 600 words in length, include the history behind OSH and the important function it serves in the community. Although the story cannot read like an advertisement for OSH, it will likely bring you some free press.  We would like the story to be a heartwarming addition to our magazine, one that will touch the hearts of readers.

Please let me know if you're interested.

Thanks,
Heather Baker
