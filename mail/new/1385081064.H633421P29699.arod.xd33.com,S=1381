Message: Greetings, 
      I am the Veteran Transition Coordinator that helps link Veterans in the State of Washington to opportunities in the field of aeronautics through technical education found at 11 participating community colleges in Washington State (Big Bend-Moses Lake; Clover Park-Tacoma; Everett; North Seattle; Olympic-Bremerton; Peninsula-Port Angles; Renton Technical; Skagit Valley; Spokane Community Coll; South Seattle and Wenatchee Valley).  I am interested in learning if there is a way my educational goals and employment opportunities associated with completion of programs could link to your agency.  Thank you for your time and efforts in this matter.
