Message: Hello,

We are asking for your help in getting the word out to all military and their families regarding our upcoming Military Appreciation Night at our store in Spokane and Spokane Valley on Friday, May 17th

Our company founder and many of our employees have proudly served in the military and this is just our way of recognizing their service and saying thank you.

If you could please post this information on your website and in any publication that you might have, it would be greatly appreciated. I could also send you fliers via mail to distribute. Just let me know.

Thank you in advance for your help with this. Please contact me with any questions.
