Message: I served in the US Navy for four years from 1999 to 2003.  I am currently unemployed and have not been able to find work for a year now.  My wife and four children are living in a three bedroom apartment.  We will be about $90 short for Augusts rent which is due August 5th.  I am wondering if you can render us any assistance with paying the last of our rent for August?  I have an interview for a job this coming monday, but if I get the job the first paycheck will come too late.

William Patterson
