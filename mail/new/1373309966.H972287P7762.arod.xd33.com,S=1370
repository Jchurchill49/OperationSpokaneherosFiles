Message: Hello,
My name is Jennifer Rohrer and I am the PR/Communications Representative for Northwest Farm Credit Services, headquartered here in Spokane... We finance Farmers and Ranchers in Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho and Alaska. Our biggest initiative now is getting veterans the funding they need to start a farm or to become involved in agriculture. We would like to present to you a donation and we were hoping we could do so in person this week, specifically on Thursday when we are downtown at the GSI building to welcome the Washington State Department of Ag Director. Let me know if you are available! My phone number is 509-340-5303. Looking forward to hearing from you ƒº
