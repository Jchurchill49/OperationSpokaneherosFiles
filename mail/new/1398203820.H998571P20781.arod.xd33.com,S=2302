Message: Hello, 

I am in charge our of Military Line Committee here at the BBB and we are always looking for opportunities to more involved in the military community here in Spokane. In 2003, the Department of Defense started the DoD Financial Readiness Campaign. They partnered with over 20 non-profits to give Service Members and their families a chance to learn more about how to manage their money. BBB was one of those partners and set up BBB Military Line in 2004 to help carry out our DoD mission. Since then, we’ve signed agreements with all the services, so we can go on military installations and help provide good consumer education to military personnel and their families – and that includes active, Reserve, Guard, and retirees. Most recently, we partnered with McGraw-Hill Companies, in an effort to support the First Lady’s Initiative, Joining Forces, that promotes civilian 
community support of the military. We’ve taught our workshops to thousands of Service Members across the United States, and we’ve also done some special products like our “BBB-Kiplinger Personal Finance Guide for Military Families.” We have Web sites for each branch of the service where you can find breaking news, sign up for our monthly newsletter, and access all the regular BBB services.

We would love to work with your organization on any relevant events. We also would love to send you our monthly newsletter with Military tips, scams and educational materials. 

If this is something your organization would be interested in, please do email me back and we can discuss future opportunities. 

Thanks you,
Michelle Stinnett
