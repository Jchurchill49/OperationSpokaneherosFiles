Message: As a former 7 year active volunteer for Operation Care and Comfort in San Jose CA, I have some experience with this type of venue and wish to continue my volunteer support for our military personnel and their families.  Please call me 509-998-1724, or reply to this email.  I have been trying to organize something similar to this and talking to GCU personnel at Fairchild.  Seems it is operational and ready for support.  Don Stone, US Navy, Retired.
