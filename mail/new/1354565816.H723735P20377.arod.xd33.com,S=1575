Message: Greetings, I am the 1st VetCorps representative for GSSAC, Greater Spokane Substance Abuse Council, in the Spokane valley. I work for Linda Thompson. 

I am also a volunteer firefighter/EMT...licensed and certified with the State of Washington since 2006. Additionally, I am a second year graduate student at Whitworth University pursuing a Master's in Education, Clinical Mental Health Counseling and my focus is Veterans and Military Families as well as Trauma. I am familiar with PTS, TBI, MST, and CSA. 

I am a veteran, my dad is a two time Vietnam Veteran, my oldest daughter currently serves in the Army Reserves, and my son serves active duty USMC. 

I am seeking a clinical practicum/internship focusing on VMF or trauma, or issues relating to VMF. Would someone be so kind to contact me? Thank you in advance for your time.
