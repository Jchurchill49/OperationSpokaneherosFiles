Message: To Whom It May Concern,
 
  My name is John Courtney & I recently retired from the military on 09/11/11 after almost 22 years of service (Active, Reserves, & Guard).  I am seeking your help, because I have NO where else to turn too and you are my last hope. I have contacted all Veteran/Military assistance organizations & because I am NOT active duty or wounded, I can not get any help, including Air Force Aid Society & Armed Forces Foundation.
 
  In Feb of this year, I was laid-off from work, however, found a part-time job and now I am working full-time, however, I cannot get caught back up on my bills.  I can now pay them starting in Dec because I will have saved up, but I cannot get caught up in my rent, my car payment, my home mortgage (rental), utilities, 1 credit card bill, & 2 AAFES Military Star card payments.  I have spoken to all and will not work with me and wait, including my landlord who is a retried AF Colonel, & I have tried to get loans, but now my credit is no good, & friends/family members cannot help either.  I am now looking at eviction, repossession, foreclosure, collections, utility shut-off, etc.  I am not looking for a hand-out!!  I am looking for a loan to help me get caught back-up and ahead thru Nov 2011, & I can start paying in Dec 2011 on my own, because I am working.  YOU ARE MY LAST HOPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  Can you or your staff help me with getting a loan from anywhere, which I will pay back????  I need basically $9,000!!!!  Sorry!!!
 
  Please, please help!!!!  I don’t know where else to turn too!  I can email you copies of my bills, lease, DD FM 214’s & NGB FM 22’s as well!
 
  Please, I have until 05 Nov 2011 to accomplish this!  All my options are now gone!
 
  Thank You for your assistance!
  John R. Courtney
