Message: I belong to a group that is looking for a "project" to help soldiers or the families of soldiers in the Spokane area. Please advise me of any ideas you might have. At this point, I have no further guidelines to give you such as how many persons/hours/dollars might be involved: I am just gathering information on your needs. Thank you.
