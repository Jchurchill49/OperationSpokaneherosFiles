Message: Hi Nancy,
We have met several times at Fairchild.  I am David Rapp's wife.
I saw your article in the Spokane Family magazine. I don't know if you could use anymore help but I'd be happy to do whatever you need. My experience is: 43 years as a mom (2 children 43 and 37) 26 years teaching elementary school.  My son is currently serving his third tour in Iraq. Let me know if you think I could be of any help.  You know, I really wasn't surprised to see that you are involved in this great operation. You're a wonderful people person!
