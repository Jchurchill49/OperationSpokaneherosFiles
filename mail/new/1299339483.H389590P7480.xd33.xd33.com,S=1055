Message: Hello my name is Miles Moore and I run an accessible/disAbled sailing program called SAIL (Self Awareness In Leisure). I am trying to locate disAbled vets such as those involved with the Wounded Warriors. I am looking for any of these Hereos that might be interested in learning to sail and/or racing. Please pass my email on to those you might be intested. Sincerely…www.funtosail.com
