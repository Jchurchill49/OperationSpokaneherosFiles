Message: Hello, 
I am associated with Operation Dog tag directed by Joe Shepard, http://www.facebook.com/OperationDogTag
Joe was referred by Jennifer with the VA Med Center at the Spokane Community College to get in contact with Sandy. He is very interested in coming to speak to Vets about his program. 
Operation Dog Tag's Mission; Operation Dog Tag is a Spokane based non-profit organization under Pointman International Ministries. We are dedicated to all of our men and women who served in combat and their families who love them. We teach and instruct these veterans to train qualified service dogs for other combat veterans to meet their critical needs, whether for assistance with post traumatic stress or crutches, canes, walkers and wheel chaired. We are very determined to help veterans and their families begin living their lives again, as we “Make Man’s Best Friend Even Better For A Veteran.”

We would love to discuss an opportunity to share our program with yours.

Thank you, Regina Gosney
