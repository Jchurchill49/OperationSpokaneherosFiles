Message: Hello, 

My organization is sponsoring an event that happens the same time as your Carousel event, and if you are okay with it, would we be able to provide 10% off coupons for participants at your event? We'll have 6 food trucks plus live entertainment on Wall Street so just a couple of blocks away (and a forest of patio heaters). My number is 456-0580x109 if you would like to call. 

Thanks in advance.  -Andrew
