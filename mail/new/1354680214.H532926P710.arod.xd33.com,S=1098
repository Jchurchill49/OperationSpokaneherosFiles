Message: Just wanted to write a THANK YOU to all who helped, supported or contributed to the Christmas Carousel on November 30! My daughters had a wonderful time, we also had some friends bring their kids and we made it a "Mommy & me night". It was such a great beginning to this holiday season! Thank you all so much! 

Sincerely, 
Joy Moon

P.S. Are we allowed to attend the meetings or should I call someone to let them know I want to attend?
