Message: I am interested in greeting our troops when they return from Iraq or Afghanistan and know of others that would be interested in the same.  I will also forward your information to others so they may contact your group as well.  My husband is a retired USN Chief of 21.5 years and we are now living in Cheney, WA.  We want to make sure our troops that return home are greeted when they arrive and not treated as many in America treated our returning troops from VietNam.  Please let me know if you have a group that does greet our troops arriving home and how we can join you in doing that.  You may reach me via email, or at 5099-299-4911.  Thank you, Pamela Stone
