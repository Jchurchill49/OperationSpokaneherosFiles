Message: Hello
I wanted to come for the meeting on Tuesday of last week but I headed back to my hometown to help with the landslide relief. I am originally from Darrington WA (the tiny town devastated by the landslide) and when we were there we met and helped many of the soldiers staying there. 

Recently y daughter and I both have done many drives for donations to give to the soldiers who were helping in my home town, and I would like to continue to do that now that we are home. My daughters school also make thank you notes for all the soldiers, we collected movies, and xbox games for their "downtime" we raised money to buy them all pizza dinners, and helped setup their living space to be more welcoming after a long day out on the slide. Their work was emotionally and physically draining so the littlest of things that brought them comfort we tired to do.

Anyways now that we are home I'd like to continue to help in anyway possible.  If you think there are any tasks to jobs you need help with I would be happy to help :) 

Sincerely 
Heather Rodin
