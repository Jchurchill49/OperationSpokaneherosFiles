Message: My name is Craig Dowdy. My wife and myself own YJ Guide Service. We run a hunting and fishing guide service. We are looking to do a handicap hunt this fall and were looking for someone who would appreciate this free hunt were giving away. Please contact me back a number of the person i should contact that deals with this type of request. Thanks Craig
