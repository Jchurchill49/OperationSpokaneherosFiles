Message: Hello!  I am on the local committee, with Holly Williamson and many others, that you all discussed last week, allowing us to create a few fundrasier events to raise money for emergency funds. We have some tentative events in the infancy stage where we have already ran by Anthony E and will soon present to you.  We are needing a letterhead to create a donation letter on in efforts to obtain small raffle and door prize items.  Additionally we need your Tax Id # for some of the companies and businesses we have contacted.  Please help ASAP.
