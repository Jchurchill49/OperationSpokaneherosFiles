Message: Hello my name is Elise I am a veteran of Iraq. I was told by someone at the WorkSource Spokane of a possible program to assist Iraq vets having problems with home repairs. I own a home that desperately needed a new roof that I can not afford. There are several places were it leaks I have tried to have it fixed to no avail. We have the roof coming down in the laundry room with mold in that area and in the attic. I would like to talk to someone about any assistance that might be available to me.

Thank you sincerely,

Elise Al-Sharif
