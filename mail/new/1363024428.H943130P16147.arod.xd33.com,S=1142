Message: My husband will deploy in April... we just got our two foster children a few weeks ago...  I need to find or hire someone to take care of our lawn.  Do you have connections to people who willingly provide such services (even High School students)?  I have all the equipment (lawn mower, weed eater etc), but know that with 4 kids to care for I won't have time to worry about lawn care.

Thanks so much for any information/resources you have,

Teresa
