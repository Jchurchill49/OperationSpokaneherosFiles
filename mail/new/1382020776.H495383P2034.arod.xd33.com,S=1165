Message: I attended my first meeting this week and was very impressed by the passion of this dedicated group of volunteers. We have a Communinty Awareness Committee at Northwest Farm Credit Services and periodically we invite local groups to do brief presentations at functions at our headquarters in Spokane. Is that something you are interested in? Please send me a contact name/# to forward to Jesika Harper who will reach out re the upcoming event. Or - you can call me at #340-5450. thanks
