Message: Hello. My employer is interested in teaming up with a local foundation like yourselves for an upcoming promotion for care packages. Is there anyway I can get an email or phone number for you guys to learn a bit more and find out some information? The only contact info I see on the website is an address. Thanks so much, Jesica.
