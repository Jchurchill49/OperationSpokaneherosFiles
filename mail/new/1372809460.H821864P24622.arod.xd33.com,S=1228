Message: Hi,
I am Mike Lish from D. Lish’s Hamburgers.  We have been looking for another local charity to work with/for during the year and we have chosen OSH.  We are donating 50 cents from every one of our Fresh Squeezed Lemonades we sell this month to OSH.  Yesterday alone we collected over $20 for Operation Spokane Heroes.  If you have any other needs in the future please give us/me a call.  We like to support our community!!!  Please help us get the word out!
