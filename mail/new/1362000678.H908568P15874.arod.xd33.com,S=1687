Message: Hi Sandy,  I belong to the Burning Boots Trail Club here in Spokane. We take veterans out on wilderness excursions (mostly backpacking) but we engage in other activities also.  We are currently awaiting the approval of our 501 (C)(3) status from the IRS.

I am currently working on our business plan and am comparing our organization to the other area veterans organizations.  I would like to meet with you in person, to find out more about Operation Spokane Heroes, and see if I could be of any assistance as I do not work anymore.
The Burning Boots Trail Club is open to ALL veterans, all branches-all era's. Our members do not have to be disabled to join or be sponsored.  Most of our existing members are already avid outdoorsman.  Our main goal is to find veterans who would like to participate in wilderness activities but cannot afford the gear, equipment and trip expenses.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kellie Richardson
Executive Director
