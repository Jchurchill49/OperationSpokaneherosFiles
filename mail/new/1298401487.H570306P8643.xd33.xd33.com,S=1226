Message: Hello!
My name is Tori Johnson. I came across your Facebook page, and am really impressed by what your organization is doing for the military. Both of my parents were in the military for 20 years (my dad was in special ops and died on active duty in 2002). I have a passion for giving back to our troops, and would love to get involved in any way. I am currently a junior at Gonzaga University, and I am pursuing a major in Public Relations and Political Science. Please let me know if I can get involved. Thank you!
Sincerely, 
Tori Johnson
