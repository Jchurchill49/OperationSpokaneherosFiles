Message: Hello, I would like to set up a time I could speak with your committee about partnering with an Organization I am part of Called FoRe beyond the green ministries and Rebecca Lawlor Limited. I am their NW Goodwill Ambassador and I have created a campaign called A Heart FoRe Heros! Together with Rebecca Lawlor Limited we are producing a beautiful piece called the "purple heart" to honor soldiers who deserve this honor in the military but never received it due to PTSD.  Each heart will be given by someone who purchases and the funds will be allocated three ways, part to your organization, part to FoRe beyond the green and then a portion of course back to Rebecca Lawlor Limited. Please let me know if you would like to discuss further.  
Thank you 
Becky Phillips
