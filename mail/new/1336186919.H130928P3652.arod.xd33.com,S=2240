Message: I apologize if this is a repeat...I wasn't sure if the last one was submitted.


Spokane has a NEW website to support non-profits and promote volunteerism.   This website is designed to direct traffic to your organization, BOTH…

1)  People who are in need of your services, and 
2)  People who want to give donations or volunteer service to your organization.

This is a FREE service to you.  

I am simply asking for…
1)	PERMISSION to place your organization on the website.
2)	and…an EMAIL address through which I can communicate with you.  

Please view the website at http://www.SpokaneCares.org.  
Click on the ORGANIZATIONS tab near the top of the page.  
Scroll down till you see your organization, and open your temporary page of information.  

When you scroll down to the bottom of your page, you will see, “This organization is listed under the following topics.”  There are 400 topics on the website.  I will place you under  the ones I feel apply to your organization—however, if you feel I have chosen wrong, or if you would like to be placed under additional topics, you can send me an email and let me know.  

If you would like to be INCLUDED on the website, I can provide you with a log-in password so that you can edit/update your information at any time.  (Remember to click the UPDATE box at the bottom of the page to save any changes.)    

Your organization can also be removed from the website upon your request

Please contact me to let me know if you would like to participate on the website.   

Thank you.
