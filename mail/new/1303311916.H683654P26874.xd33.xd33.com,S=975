Message: Hi there.. I have a few 5th graders at Liberty Lake Elementary that would like to put together care packages for soldiers as a community service project.  I wanted to check with your organization for ideas, suggestions...and perhaps to channel us in the right direction.  I would appreciate any help!
Karla
