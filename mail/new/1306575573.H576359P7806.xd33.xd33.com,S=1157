Message: I am going to be homeless in less then 3 days now. I owe $2086 in order to stay in an apartment. i lost my job 2 months ago.
I've been in Spokane since 2008, fighting w the VA for a service connected rating. Still, none. I have issues with my abdomen and PTSD. 
to add insult to injury, was offered a great job, a block away from where Live. now, w eviction looming, I will be jobless and homeless..this has been an ongoing battle since 2006..
Is there any assistance available?
