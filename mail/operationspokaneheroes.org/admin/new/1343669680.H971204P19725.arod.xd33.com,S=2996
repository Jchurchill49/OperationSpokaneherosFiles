Dear Google Accounts user,

Congratulations on signing up for 2-step verification! Now that your account
is more secure, you'll need to complete just a couple more steps
to make sure you can always access your account.

SET UP YOUR BACKUP PHONE

What if you don't have your phone? If you ever lose access to your primary
phone number, Google can send a code to a backup, like your home or work
phone. To set up a backup phone, follow these steps:

Go to https://accounts.google.com/SmsAuthConfig
Click on "Add a phone number: next to "Backup phone number."
Enter your phone number and select whether you want to send codes by SMS or
by voice call.

PRINT A SET OF BACKUP CODES

If you're travelling or don't have access to your primary or backup phone,
you can use a backup code to sign in. We'll give you a set of 10 codes that
you can keep in your wallet or save as a file on your computer. If you run
out of codes, you can always create more.

Go to https://accounts.google.com/SmsAuthConfig
Click "Show/Generate codes."
Print or download your codes, and keep them in a safe place.
