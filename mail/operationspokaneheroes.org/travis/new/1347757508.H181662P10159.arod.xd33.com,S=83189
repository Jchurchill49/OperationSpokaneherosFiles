r similar information.
- Financial information - the full bank account numbers and/or credit card =
numbers that you link to=20=20=20
your PayPal account or give us when you use the PayPal Services.
=20
Before permitting you to use the PayPal Services, we may require you to pro=
vide additional information=20
we can use to verify your identity or address or manage risk, such as your =
date of birth, social security=20
number or other information. We may also obtain information about you from =
third parties such as=20
credit bureaus and identity verification services.
=20
When you use the PayPal Services, we collect information about your transac=
tions and your other=20
activities on our website, application or when using the PayPal Services an=
d we may collect information=20
about your computer or other access device for fraud prevention purposes.
=20
You may choose to provide us with access to certain personal information st=
ored by third parties such=20
as social media sites (such as Facebook and Twitter). The information we ha=
ve access to varies by site=20
and is controlled by your privacy settings on that site and your authorizat=
ion. By associating an account=20
managed by a third party with your PayPal account and authorizing PayPal to=
 have access to this=20
information, you agree that PayPal may collect, store and use this informat=
ion in accordance with this=20
Privacy Policy.

tion, we may collect=20
information about your use and interaction with our website, application or=
 the PayPal Services. For=20
example, we may evaluate your computer, mobile phone or other access device=

=20
How we use cookies
=20
When you access our website or content or use our application or the PayPal=
 Services, we or companies=20
we work with, may place small data files called cookies or pixel tags on yo=
ur computer or other device.=20
We use these technologies to recognize you as a PayPal customer, customize =
the PayPal Services, content=20
and advertising, measure promotional effectiveness, collect information abo=
ut your computer or other=20
access device to mitigate risk, help prevent fraud and promote trust and sa=
fety.
=20
We use both session and persistent cookies when you access our website or c=
ontent. Session cookies=20
expire and no longer have any effect when you log out of your account or cl=
ose your browser. Persistent=20
cookies remain on your browser until you erase them or they expire.
=20
We also use Local Shared Objects, commonly referred to as "Flash cookies", =
to help ensure that your=20
account security is not compromised, to spot irregularities in behavior to =
help prevent fraud and to support=20
our sites and services.
=20
We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored =
in them. You are free to decline=20

erfere with your use of our=20
website. The help section of most browsers or browser add-ons provides inst=
ructions on blocking, deleting=20
or disabling cookies.
=20
You may encounter PayPal cookies or pixel tags on websites that we do not c=
ontrol. For example, if you view a=20
web page created by a third party or use an application developed by a thir=
d party, there may be a cookie or=20
pixel tag placed by the web page or application. Likewise, these third part=
ies may place cookies or pixel tags=20
that are not subject to our control and the PayPal Privacy Policy does not =
cover their use.
=20
How we protect and store personal information
=20
Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe =
information that can be associated=20
with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not c=
onsider personal information to=20
include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a=
 specific user.
=20
We store and process your personal information on our computers in the US a=
nd elsewhere in the world=20
where PayPal facilities or our service providers are located, and we protec=
t it by maintaining physical,=20
electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US feder=
al and state regulations.=20
We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforc=
e physical access controls=20
to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information=
 only for those employees=20
who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.
=20
How we use the personal information we collect
=20
Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you wi=
th a secure, smooth, efficient,=20
and customized experience. We may use your personal information to:
=20
- provide the PayPal Services and customer support you request;
- process transactions and send notices about your transactions;
- resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;
- prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our Use=
r Agreement;
- customize, measure, and improve the PayPal Services and the content and l=
ayout of our website and applications;
- deliver targeted marketing, service update notices, and promotional offer=
s based on your communication preferences;
- compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.
=20

=20

marketing purposes without=20
your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we =
collect from other=20
companies and use it to improve and personalize the PayPal Services, conten=
t and advertising.=20

e in our ad-customization=20
programs, simply indicate your preference by logging into your account and =
going to the Profile subtab=20

You can opt out of receiving SMS messages by texting STOP to the number we =
send from for that=20
particular service. Alternatively, you can indicate your preference by logg=
ing into your account and=20
adjusting your preferences under Account Information or by following the di=
rections provided=20

=20
How we share personal information with other PayPal users
=20
To process your payments, we may share some of your personal information wi=
th the person or=20
company that you are paying or that is paying you. Your contact information=
, date of sign-up, the=20
number of payments you have received from verified PayPal users, and whethe=
r you have verified=20
control of a bank account are provided to other PayPal users who you transa=
ct with through PayPal.=20
In addition, this and other information may also be shared with third parti=
es when you use these=20
third parties to access the PayPal Services. Unless you have agreed to it, =
these third parties are=20
not allowed to use this information for any purpose other than to enable th=
e PayPal Services.
=20
If you are buying goods or services and pay through PayPal, we may also pro=
vide the seller with your=20
shipping and confirmed credit card billing address to help complete your tr=
ansaction with the seller.=20
The seller is not allowed to use this information to market their services =
to you unless you have=20
agreed to it. If an attempt to pay your seller fails, or is later invalidat=
ed, we may also provide your=20
seller with details of the unsuccessful payment. To facilitate dispute reso=
lutions, we may provide a=20
buyer with the seller's address so that goods can be returned to the seller.
=20
We work with third parties, including merchants, to enable them to accept o=
r facilitate payments from=20
or to you using PayPal. In doing so, a third party may share information ab=
out you with us, such as=20
your email address or mobile phone number to inform you that a payment is s=
ent to you or when you=20
attempt to pay that merchant or through that third party. We use this infor=
mation to confirm that you=20
are a PayPal customer and that PayPal as a form of payment can be enabled, =
or where a payment is=20
sent to you to send you notification that you have received a payment. Also=
, if you request that we=20
validate your status as a PayPal customer with a third party, we will do so=
. Please note that merchants=20
you buy from and contract with have their own privacy policies, and PayPal =
may not be held responsible=20
for their operations, including, but not limited to, their information prac=
tices.
=20
Regardless, we will not disclose your credit card number or bank account nu=
mber to anyone you have=20
paid or who has paid you through PayPal or with the third parties that offe=
r or use the PayPal Services,=20
except with your express permission or if we are required to do so to compl=
y with a credit card rules,=20
subpoena or other legal process.
=20
How we share personal information with other parties
=20
We may share your personal information with:
=20
- Members of the eBay Inc. corporate family -- like eBay, Shopping.com or B=
ill Me Later, Inc.--=20
  to provide joint content, products and services (like registration, trans=
actions and customer support),=20
  to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our=
 policies, and to guide decisions=20
  about their products, services and communications. Members of our corpora=
te family will use this=20
  information to send you marketing communications only if you have request=
ed their services.
- Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business oper=
ations such as fraud=20
  prevention, bill collection, marketing and technology services. Our contr=
acts dictate that these service=20
  providers only use your information in connection with the services they =
perform for us and not for=20
  their own benefit.
- Financial institutions that we partner with to jointly create and offer a=
 product such as the PayPal Extras=20
  credit card where we share information with GE Capital to determine wheth=
er you should receive=20
  pre-approved offers for the PayPal Extras credit card. These financial in=
stitutions may only use this=20
  information to market PayPal-related products, unless you have given cons=
ent for other uses.
-Credit bureaus to report account information, as permitted by law.
- Banking partners as required by credit card association rules for inclusi=
on on their list of terminated=20
  merchants (in the event that you meet their criteria which includes havin=
g PayPal close your PayPal Account=20
  due to your breach of the PayPal User Agreement).
- Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. (Should such a co=
mbination occur, we will require=20
   that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to =
your personal information. If your personal=20
  information could be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior=
 notice.)
- Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when=20
   - we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal =
procedure
   - we need to do so to comply with law or credit card rules
   - we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information i=
s necessary to prevent physical harm or=20
     financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate=
 violations of our User Agreement.
- Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.
=20
PayPal will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third part=
ies for their marketing purposes and=20
only shares your personal information with third parties as described in th=
is policy.
=20
If you open a PayPal account directly on a third party website or via a thi=
rd party application, any information=20
that you enter on that website or application (and not directly on a PayPal=
 website) will be shared with the owner=20
of the third party website or application and your information may be subje=
ct to their privacy policies.
=20
How you can restrict PayPal from sharing your personal information
=20
Federal and state laws allow you to restrict the sharing of your personal i=
nformation in certain instances. However,=20
these laws also state that you cannot restrict other types of sharing. Beca=
use we have chosen to refrain from=20
certain types of data sharing, the only type of sharing of your personal in=
formation that you may restrict is as follows:
=20
If you do not want PayPal to share your personal information with eBay comp=
anies for the purpose of marketing=20
their products or with other financial institutions for the purpose of mark=
eting our jointly offered products to you,=20
please log in to your account and uncheck the box in the Information Sharin=
g section of the Notifications and Information=20
Sharing page. This page can be accessed by going to the Profile subtab unde=
r the My Account tab.
=20
You can also control how we use your contact information to market the PayP=
al Services to you in the notifications preferences.
=20
How you can access or change your personal information
=20
You can review and edit your personal information at any time by logging in=
 to your account and clicking the Profile=20
subtab under the My Account tab. You can also close your account through th=
e PayPal website. If you close your=20
PayPal account, we will mark your account in our database as "Closed," but =
will keep your account information in=20
our database. This is necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that p=
ersons who try to commit fraud will not=20
be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a ne=
w account. However, if you close your=20
account, your personally identifiable information will not be used by us fo=
r any further purposes, nor sold or shared=20
with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enf=
orcement, as required by law or in accordance=20
with this Privacy Policy.

we do not control. For example, if you view a web page created by a third p=
