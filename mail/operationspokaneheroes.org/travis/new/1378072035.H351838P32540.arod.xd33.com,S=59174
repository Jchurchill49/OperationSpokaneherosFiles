           During the course of our investigation, we may request additiona=
l information from you. <br /><br />

Once you notify us of a suspected error, we will investigate your complaint=
 or question within 10 business days (or up to 20 business days for new acc=
ounts =E2=80=93 accounts that have 30 days or fewer since the date of their=
 first transaction). If we need more time, we may take up to 45 days to com=
plete our investigation (or up to 90 days for new accounts, point of sale o=
r foreign initiated transactions). <br /><br />

If we decide that we need more time to complete our investigation (as expla=
ined directly above), we will provisionally credit your account for the amo=
unt of the suspected error. You will receive the provisional credit within =
10 business days of the date we received your notice (20 business days for =
new accounts). This will allow you to have use of the money until we comple=
te the investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in wr=
iting and we do not receive your written=20
complaint or question within 10 business days (or 20 for new accounts), we =
will not provisionally credit your account. <br /><br />

We will inform you of our decision within three business days after complet=
ing our investigation. If we determine that there was an error, we will pro=
mptly correct the error. If you have already received a provisional credit,=
 you will be allowed to retain those funds. If we decide that there was not=
 an error, we will include an explanation of our decision in our email to y=
ou. If you received a provisional credit, we will remove it from your accou=
nt. You may request copies of the documents that=20
we used in our investigation. <br /><br />

For this purpose, our "business days" are Monday through Friday. Holidays a=
re not included as business days.=20
